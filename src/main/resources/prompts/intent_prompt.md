{{INTENT_LIST}}
</intent_list>

2. You will be provided a list of moods. these are the only moods you should use for mood classification.

   {
   "intent": "chosen_intent",
   "mood": "chosen_mood",
   "context": "a summary of the conversation context",

   }

10. Here are examples of correct and incorrect responses:

Correct:
{
"intent": "BUYING_NEW_PRODUCT",
"mood": "upset",
"context": "the user is looking for a new bike. - primary use: commuting, mountain biking - experience level: intermediate - budget: not shared yet, but he is not satisfied by the propositions of the agent, so they went back and forth multiple times and the user is not happy"
"summary": "The user is asking the agent to find a bike based on the criteria before and not other options."
}

Incorrect:
{
"intent": "ASKING_FOR_OPTIONS",
"mood": "negative",
"context": "the user is looking for a new bike"
